This is the source code for Room 613 a short survival horror game avalible now on the [google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZeSpy.Room613).If you have any suggestions on how to improve the efficiency of the code or different ways to go about doing things, Iâ€™d be more than happy to hear it. 
### Explore the Project
To see how everything functions you'll need the latest version of [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download) and that's it.

Simply clone the repo and open the cloned directory as a project through unity. All scripts are written in C#, with a small description at the start of each script telling you what it does. The file structure is self explanatory: everything is where you think it might be. 

### Acknowledgements
All assets in the game are either created by myself or are standard assets provided by unity, except for the following:
The mannequin model used for enemies: https://poly.google.com/view/c1Hf1Rv-OAz    
The paper texture used for the ingame map was created by someone going by the username "dioma" on deviantart. They have since deactivated their deviantart account. This is where the texture file used to be: https://www.deviantart.com//art/Textures-Paper-58028330
